## SECTION A — Purpose & Philosophy

### A1. What is SSUM-Snow, in simple terms?

SSUM-Snow is a **deterministic structural trust framework** for snow forecasting.

It does not try to predict snow at all times.  
Instead, it answers a more fundamental operational question:

**“Is it structurally safe to trust a snow forecast right now?”**

SSUM-Snow:
- does **not** force predictions
- does **not** chase magnitude
- does **not** hallucinate depth

It permits forecasts **only when structure supports trust**.

---

### A2. Why introduce structural trust in snow forecasting?

Because many real-world failures are caused by **false confidence**, not missing data.

In practice:
- snow is predicted when structure is unstable
- thresholds produce false alarms
- depth spikes appear without persistence

SSUM-Snow prevents this by **gating forecasts through structural permissibility** before any depth is considered.

---

### A3. Does SSUM-Snow replace weather models or forecasts?

No.

SSUM-Snow never replaces:
- numerical weather prediction (NWP)
- radar or ensemble systems
- classical meteorological science

It augments them by answering:

**“Should this forecast be trusted here?”**

---

### A4. Is SSUM-Snow theoretical or philosophical?

No.

SSUM-Snow is:
- fully executable
- deterministic
- validated across multiple real stations
- traceable and auditable

Every claim is backed by **observable structural outputs**.

---

## SECTION B — How SSUM-Snow Works

### B1. What exactly does SSUM-Snow evaluate?

SSUM-Snow evaluates **structural coherence**, not raw magnitude.

It observes:
- stability of hourly structure
- accumulation consistency
- collapse pressure
- regime transitions

Only **structurally admissible windows** are allowed to produce forecasts.

---

### B2. What do “admissibility”, “corridor”, and “collapse” mean?

- **Admissibility**: structure is stable enough to speak  
- **Corridor**: a continuous window of trust-permitted structure  
- **Collapse**: structural violence forces prediction to zero  

Magnitude alone **never grants permission**.

---

### B3. Why does SSUM-Snow focus on hourly structure?

Because trust breaks at **short timescales first**.

Hourly resolution:
- captures regime instability early
- prevents threshold-driven false alarms
- enables safer near-term decisions

Daily aggregation is secondary and intentionally conservative.

---

### B4. What does it mean that SSUM-Snow “collapses to zero”?

It means:
- when structure is unstable, predicted snow collapses to zero
- no smoothing, interpolation, or guessing is applied

This is a **safety feature**, not a failure.

---

### B5. Is SSUM-Snow tied to a specific climate or station?

No.

SSUM-Snow uses **invariant structural laws**:
- no station-specific tuning
- no regional bias correction
- no climate-dependent parameters

The same logic applies everywhere.

---

## SECTION C — Trust Gating, Not Prediction Forcing

### C1. Why does SSUM-Snow sometimes refuse to predict?

Because prediction under instability is unsafe.

SSUM-Snow prefers **silence over false confidence**.

---

### C2. Can SSUM-Snow suppress forecasts even when snow occurs?

Yes.

Snow may occur without being **predictably trustworthy**.

SSUM-Snow explicitly separates:
- occurrence
- predictability
- trust

---

### C3. Is silence a valid outcome?

Yes.

Silence means:
- high uncertainty
- structural violence
- elevated false-signal risk

This is **intentional and informative**.

---

## SECTION D — Structural States & Signals

### D1. What structural states does SSUM-Snow report?

Derived states such as:
- CALM
- STABLE
- PRESSURIZED
- COLLAPSING

These are **computed**, not subjectively assigned.

---

### D2. What is structural violence?

Structural violence is **instability in atmospheric coherence**, not physical violence.

It often precedes:
- false alarms
- erratic depth swings
- forecast failure

---

### D3. What is a snow corridor?

A snow corridor is a **continuous interval of admissible structure** where prediction is safe.

SSUM-Snow forecasts **only inside corridors**.

---

## SECTION E — Deterministic Validation

### E1. Why are multi-station proof cases included?

To ensure:
- reproducibility
- universality
- zero ambiguity

No single-station tuning is used.

---

### E2. What do the hourly cases demonstrate?

They demonstrate that SSUM-Snow:
- suppresses false alarms consistently
- admits only stable snow windows
- behaves similarly across climates

---

### E3. Why are false alarms near zero across stations?

Because **admissibility precedes magnitude**.

Unstable regimes never reach depth mapping.

---

### E4. Why is daily depth not the primary objective?

Because SSUM-Snow is a **trust framework**, not a depth-fitting model.

Daily depth is:
- conservative
- secondary
- intentionally under-aggressive

---

## SECTION F — Relationship to SSUM & Other Systems

### F1. How is SSUM-Snow related to SSUM?

SSUM provides the **structural mathematics**.  
SSUM-Snow is a **domain application** of those principles.

---

### F2. Is SSUM-Snow related to SSE or governance systems?

No.

SSUM-Snow does not enforce decisions.  
It signals **trust**, not authority.

---

### F3. Can SSUM-Snow be used without other Shunyaya tools?

Yes.

SSUM-Snow is fully usable **on its own**.

---

## SECTION G — Usage, Safety & Scope

### G1. Is SSUM-Snow safe for operational use?

Yes, because it is:
- non-invasive
- deterministic
- conservative
- collapse-safe

It never overrides classical forecasts.

---

### G2. Why is determinism mandatory?

Because trust must be **auditable**.

Same inputs → same outputs.  
Every time.

---

### G3. Why are learning and tuning avoided?

Because they hide causality.

SSUM-Snow exposes **structure explicitly**.

---

### G4. How should users act on SSUM-Snow outputs?

Use SSUM-Snow as a **trust qualifier**:
- act confidently when permitted
- act cautiously when silent

---

### G5. Does SSUM-Snow ever disagree with classical forecasts?

Yes — and this is intentional.

SSUM-Snow evaluates **structural trust**, not physical possibility.  
It may suppress prediction even when classical models indicate snowfall.

This does not mean classical models are wrong.  
It means issuing a confident forecast would be **structurally unsafe**.

Disagreement is therefore a **signal**, not a conflict.

---

## SECTION H — The Bigger Picture

### H1. Is SSUM-Snow standalone or extensible?

Both.

It can extend to:
- other precipitation types
- hazard forecasting
- infrastructure risk windows

---

### H2. Why is SSUM-Snow considered impactful?

Because it restores something forecasting lacks:

**The ability to say “no” safely.**

---

### H3. What is the long-term significance?

SSUM-Snow introduces a new forecasting primitive:

**Structural trust before prediction.**

---

## ONE-LINE SUMMARY

**SSUM-Snow predicts only when prediction deserves trust — and stays silent when it does not.**
